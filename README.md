You can make your own note by editing text file with any programs.

Rules of notes should like:

If the note looks like:

1 3
3 7
8 5|1

it means "Drop 3rd note at 1st frame, drop 7th note at 3rd frame and drop 5th and 1st notes at 8th frame".

# Is the note making should done by hands?

Unfortunately, yes. Since this program is made by one developer, there's no notes making program. So, if you have a good idea or good programs to make notes, please contact to stardung86@gmail.com or leave issue in this repository.
